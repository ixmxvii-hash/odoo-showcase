## PRICING QUICK REFERENCE

### Odoo License
**$24.90/user/month** (annual billing)

| Users | Annual Cost |
|-------|-------------|
| 10 | $2,988 |
| 25 | $7,470 |
| 50 | $14,940 |
| 100 | $29,880 |

- **Medium (25-50 users):** $30,000 - $60,000
- **Large (50-100 users):** $60,000 - $100,000

- "Typical clients save 15-25 hours/week per department"
- "That's $50-100K/year in recovered productivity"

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We can't afford it right now"
> "I understand budget is a concern. But what's the cost of NOT automating? If your team is spending 15 hours/week on manual data entry, that's $30K+ per year. Odoo pays for itself in 8-12 months. We also offer flexible payment plans."

### "We don't have time for a big implementation"
> "That's actually why Odoo is different. We go live in 90 days, not 12 months. We implement in phases, so there's minimal disruption. Most clients see productivity gains by month 3."

### "We're worried about data migration"
> "Totally valid concern. We have a 5-step migration process we've used on 100+ projects with zero data loss. We run parallel systems for 2-4 weeks so you're never at risk."

### "Our team isn't very technical"
> "If they can use Excel, they can use Odoo. The interface is designed for business users, not IT. We provide role-based training — your accounting team learns accounting, your warehouse team learns inventory. Most people are comfortable within 2 weeks."

### "We're looking at NetSuite/SAP too"
> "Great — those are solid products. The main differences: Odoo is 70% cheaper over 5 years, we implement in 3 months instead of 12, and you get local on-site support instead of a 1-800 number. Want me to send you a TCO comparison?"

### "We need to think about it"
> "Absolutely, this is a big decision. What would help you move forward? Would a demo with your actual data help? Or I can connect you with a similar [industry] company that's using Odoo."

---

## CLOSING OPTIONS

### Soft Close (Qualifying)
> "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like Odoo could save you [X] hours per week and eliminate those [pain point] issues. Would it make sense to schedule a 30-minute demo so you can see it in action?"

### Discovery Workshop
> "We offer a free 2-hour discovery workshop where we map your current processes and build a custom ROI analysis. No obligation — you'll walk away with a clear picture of what's possible. Does next Tuesday or Thursday work?"

### Demo
> "Let me show you exactly how this would work for [their industry]. I can set up a 45-minute demo with our implementation team. What day works best?"

### Proof of Concept
> "If you want to test the waters, we can do a 30-day pilot with one department. Low risk, and you'll have real data to make your decision. Interested?"

## RED FLAGS (When to Disqualify)

- **< 5 employees:** Too small, recommend Odoo Community (free) or QuickBooks
- **No budget:** "We have zero budget" — ask when they'll have budget, nurture
- **No pain:** "Everything's fine" — they're not ready, nurture
- **No timeline:** "Maybe next year" — schedule 6-month follow-up
- **No authority:** "I'm just researching for my boss" — ask to include decision-maker
- **Already signed with competitor:** Document learnings, move on
